## About Us 

#### History 
The club was envisioned by a cadet in 2019 when the Academy was at the height of the FalconSat program. The cadet saw a need to develop the rocket engineering and research side of the
Academyâ€™s space program. He originally shared his idea with the head of the Astronautics Department. Today, the team represents the Academy at a competitive collegiate level.

The team has successfully competed in the NASA USLI (University Student Launch Initiative) in 2022, 2023, and 2024, with their most successful year in 2024 being one of 13 teams to qualify their payload out of 50 for the final launch. Learn more about the 2024 season [here](2024.md).

Currently in 2025 the team is competing in the [FAR-OUT liquid rocketry competition](https://www.faroutlaunch.org/teams) with the goal of successfully launching a bi-propellant liquid rocket. 



#### Team Structure
The team is split into multiple sub-groups, which change from semester to semester. Currently the team is split into three divisions, [research](research.md), [support](support.md), and [competition](competition.md).
